MEN-MVC-FRAMEWORK

Mongoose-Express-Node 
MVC-Framework

I created this framework, to follow
standard MVC-pattern for 
APP/Web Development

Main goal of this repo is to support MVC's main goal
to decouple various components of an application.
Developers will be able to work in parallel on
different components without impacting or blocking one another.
